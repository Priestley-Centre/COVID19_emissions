Spreadsheets of monthly emissions, concentations and forcings for four scenarios from 1765-2050


## Pathway what-if assumptions

Based on Climate Action Tracker projections https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/addressing-the-climate-and-post-covid-19-economic-crises/

## Baseline
Follows emissions until 2030 consistent with a successful implementation of the  current Nationally 
Determined Contributions (NDC) submitted by individual countries under the Paris Agreement, adapted from Rogelj et al (2017). Emissions continue after 2030 assuming no significant strengthening in climate action. 
	
## Two-year blip.
Reflecting potential SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics21 this case explores 66% of the April 2020 lockdown 
persisting  until the end of 2021, then emissions linearly recover to baseline by the end of 2022.
This implies a persistent necessity of partial lockdowns until the end of 2023, but with  no lasting effect of SARS-CoV-2.

## Fossil-fuelled recovery	
Follows the two-year blip pathway until end of 2021, then emissions recover in a way similar to the
recovery after the 2008/9 global recession, rebounding to 4.5% above where the baseline at the end of 2022. Stimulus packages are designed with strong support for fossil-fuel energy supply, resulting in more fossil investment than a pre-COVID current policy scenario (+1%) and considerably less in low-carbon alternatives (-0.8%). Resulting emissions are 10% higher in 2030 than the baseline scenario,a trend which is assumed to continue thereafter 2030 data taken from Climate Action tracker,“rebound to fossil fuel scenario” with the relative increase in emissions compared to baseline continued thereafter. 
  
## Moderate Green stimulus 
Follows the two-year blip pathway until end of 2021, then emissions recover slightly, 
until the end of 2022, but never reach the baseline projections. Governments choose recovery packages
to target specific low-carbon energy supply, energy efficiency, and do not support bailouts for fossil firms.
The resulting investment differential (+0.8% for low-carbon technologies and -0.3% for fossil fuels
relative to a current-policy scenario), begins to structurally change the intensity of emissions from
economic activity, resulting in about a 35% decrease by 2030 relative to the baseline scenario, a trend 
which is assumed to continue thereafter

## Strong green stimulus 
As the moderate green stimulus with investment differentials (+1.2% for low-carbon 
technologies and -0.4% for fossil fuels relative to a current policy scenario, resulting in a slightly more 
than 50% decrease by 2030 relative to the baseline scenario. Also this trend is assumed to continue thereafter.
