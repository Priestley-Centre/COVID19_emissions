# COVID19_emissions
Mobility  -based estimates of emission change from COVID19 for 2020 and projections forward

Uses Google mobility data to estimate 2020 emission change due to COVID 19 restrictions and then examine its climate impact
Uses the sector based analyses of Le Quere et al. (2020) nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0797-x  as a basis

Based on a submitted paper
## Current and future global climate impacts resulting from COVID-19
